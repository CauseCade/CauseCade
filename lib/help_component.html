                CauseCade is an educational tool created to explain Bayesian Networks to users. It does not seek to
                outperform existing Bayesian network tools. The difficulty of the course is undergraduate at worst,
                but we hope to make it accessible to high school students by making continuous improvements and
                thereby increasing accessibility.
