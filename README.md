# CauseCade - Bayesian Networks

This repository will contain my best efforts to both learn about the interesting world of bayesian networks and implement them in an accessible manner. I am currently attempting to implement this using Dart and an adaption of D3 for the graphical representation (using https://github.com/rwl/d3.dart package). These choices are subject to change.

While this may not be too hard of a project for a seasoned programmer, I am still quite new to javascript and dart, so this will truly force me to improve in those areas. Additionally I will have to read up on my probability theory and efficient algorithm creating to get anywhere close to having a functional product.

## Purpose ##

In the end, I hope this project will result in a page that can teach others about bayesian networks and allow for some basic use cases (on the go). While there are currently great programs that can be used to locally compute solutions and solve problems using bayesian networks, I feel there is still room for an easy to use, educational tool focussing on them.

## Update March 2017 ##

Work on the project will continue again. Hopefully the basic bayesian network should be operational this month, freeing up time for UI design.

## todo List for this Project ##

* Develop an intuitive UI
    * Allow Saving of Network
    * Allow Network to be opened (from file explorer) (already functional from Json)
    * Find a way to make the reset button clear the SVG
* Write/find a moderately efficient bayesian network algorithm (inference etc)
* Visually represent the data in the algorithm
* Allow for interactivity with the network
* Create example cases
* Create a sort of 'teaching' mode, that will explain the functioning of the network
* Add search function
* Add Greeting Screen
* Create Help screen
* Create Blog (gh-pages)
* Find a way to host this project
